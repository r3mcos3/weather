# Omarchy Better Weather 

Omarchy Better Weather is a Quickshell widget for the Omarchy top bar. It requires
Omarchy, Quickshell, and `curl`.

The plugin combines public data from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/),
[wttr.in](https://wttr.in/), [RainViewer](https://www.rainviewer.com/),
[ipwho.is](https://ipwho.is/),
[Esri World Imagery](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=10df2279f9684e4a9f6a7f08febac1a8),
and [CARTO](https://carto.com/basemaps/) to provide weather forecasts, current
conditions, radar, satellite imagery, and map tiles. No account, API key, or
special permissions are required. Installation, configuration, and removal
instructions are provided below.

- Satellite imagery with CARTO city labels, roads, and map outlines underneath the radar.
- Search for and change the location directly from the panel.
- Automatic location detection when no city is configured.
- Metric and imperial unit support.
- Configurable automatic refresh interval.

## Installation

Install and configure the plugin with the standard Omarchy plugin manager:

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/guiestrela/weather.git --enable && omarchy plugin disable omarchy.weather && omarchy bar move io.github.guiestrela.weather --section center --index 4 && omarchy restart shell
```

Verify the installation with:

```bash
omarchy plugin list
omarchy plugin validate ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.guiestrela.weather
```

To update the installed plugin:

```bash
omarchy plugin update io.github.guiestrela.weather
```

To remove the plugin:

```bash
omarchy plugin remove io.github.guiestrela.weather
```

## Usage

Click the weather widget to open the panel.

- Left-click: open or close the panel.
- Middle-click: refresh the weather data.
- Right-click: send the weather summary as a notification.
- In the panel, click the city name to search for another location.

The plugin uses Open-Meteo for daily forecasts and wttr.in for current conditions and as a fallback.

## Privacy and network access

The plugin does not require an account or API key, but it does contact public
third-party services. When a location is configured, its name and/or
coordinates are sent to Open-Meteo and wttr.in for weather data, and to
RainViewer, Esri World Imagery, and CARTO to load map imagery and labels. When
no location is configured, ipwho.is is used for IP-based location detection.
Requests use HTTPS. The plugin does not send credentials or store API keys.

## Configuration

Settings are read through the Omarchy module system. Available options include:

- `unit`: `auto`, `metric`, or `imperial`. `auto` follows the system timezone
  (with the system locale as fallback).
- `refreshMinutes`: refresh interval in minutes.

To choose the temperature unit from the terminal:

```bash
# System default
omarchy bar set io.github.guiestrela.weather unit auto

# Celsius
omarchy bar set io.github.guiestrela.weather unit metric

# Fahrenheit
omarchy bar set io.github.guiestrela.weather unit imperial
```

Restart the shell after changing the setting:

```bash
omarchy restart shell
```

The selected location is stored at:

```text
~/.local/state/omarchy/settings/weather.json
```

This file is managed by the `omarchy-weather-location` command.

## Project structure

- `manifest.json`: plugin metadata and entry point.
- `BarWidget.qml`: widget displayed in the bar.
- `Panel.qml`: pop-up panel, location editing, and network requests.
- `Model.js`: weather data, temperature, and icon processing.

## Recent changes

- Updated the daily view to show yesterday, today, and the following 5 days.
- Reduced the daily query to fetch only the displayed forecast range.
- Added a dedicated current-day forecast section above the daily forecast.
- The current-day forecast displays the icon, high, low, and rain probability when provided by the API.
- Added an hourly forecast strip with a draggable horizontal scrollbar.
- Added hiking, cycling, running, and camping recommendations based on rain, wind, temperature, and storm conditions.
- Added a live RainViewer radar section below the activity forecasts.
- Kept the radar layer permanently enabled without layer-switching buttons.
- Kept the detailed map zoom at level 10 while scaling RainViewer's level-7
  radar tiles to fit the map.
- Added separate data normalization for today and future forecast days.
- Reorganized the forecast into an aligned daily list with day/night symbols.

## Development

The plugin has no local Node.js dependencies. To validate the data-processing functions:

```bash
node --check Model.js
```

The panel should be tested inside an Omarchy/Quickshell session because it depends on the `qs.Commons`, `qs.Ui`, and shell component modules.

Radar imagery is provided by [RainViewer](https://www.rainviewer.com/) and is
available for personal, educational, and small community use.
